# Introduction
Business is an interesting field because of its practicality. (The Greeks would call it
a tékhnē: a craft) The world runs on basic economic principles, and being able to succeed 
in the 21st century means understanding how to harness business principles.

I'm interested in sustainability and the intersection between tech/business!
